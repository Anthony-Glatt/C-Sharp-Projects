# C-Sharp-Projects

This repository houses my C# projects.

Project 1: Twenty One
This project is the classic card game Twenty One or BlackJack. This program allows the user to play against a dealer by hitting or staying to try their best to reach a score of 21 without busting. I created this game in one of my JavaScript projects, but this project taught me a lot about object orientated programming as well as compartmentalizing code. 

Project 2: CarInsurance
This project is a web application for users to apply for car insurance. The users is asked to enter pertinent information for their application. From their the code will calculate their monthly rate based off their information. This project not only utilizes C# but also database management through Entity Framework and the design pattern MVC.

Project 3: Newsletter
This project is a web application for users to sign up for a newsletter. The user is presented with a sign up page where they provide their first name, last name, and email. The code checks to ensure that these inputs match correct formats. If the users input to meet the formatting rules, they are then taken to a new page informing them of their successful submission of data. This program also has an admin page for viewing all users information as well as a button for unsubscribing a user.
